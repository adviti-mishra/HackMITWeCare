Dr. Bradley Bousquet's professionalism and empathy immediately put my dad at ease, which was no small feat given the emotional and physical trauma he had endured. The surgery itself was a true work of art. Dr. Bousquet's precision and skill were evident in every stitch and suture. He not only repaired the lacerations but also took great care to minimize scarring and ensure the best possible outcome.Beyond his surgical talent, Dr. Bousquet's kindness and compassion stood out throughout the entire journey. He treated my dad with the utmost respect and dignity, making him feel valued as a person, not just a patient.I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Bousquet to anyone seeking a plastic surgeon who combines unparalleled surgical skills with genuine compassion and care. He transformed a traumatic experience into a story of hope and healing for our family, and for that, we are eternally grateful.

Unfortunately, that was not at all the case. Lorenzo Albala was my ER doctor and he completely missed the main reasons I went to the ER. I could tell right away he believed nothing was medically wrong with me and it was all in my head. He didn't listen to me or even look into the symptoms I said I was most concerned with- my vision and a gyn issue. Instead, he made snap judgements based on what he saw - a fat, middle aged, white woman with anxiety and past depression.Instead of listening actively, Lorenzo took some of what I said, twisted it, and branded me with an unsupported mental health diagnosis. Now I have to go through patient advocacy and make a case for having it struck from my record. Lorenzo ignored my request for one specific blood test and ordered unnecessary tests that I already had. The phlebotomist was also disappointing.I told her how I have small veins and showed her the only two veins that I have success with when drawing blood. But she chose to try a vein on my left hand instead, I guess she thinks she knows my body better than me.anyway she could not collect from that vein and busted a blood vessel while trying.Little did I know that busting a blood vessel can cause you to feel faint. Nobody warned me. Nor did they ask if I had breakfast or lunch (nope). Nobody gave me kiosk juice,'crackers or even water,. \xa0Driving home I lost Consciousness on the highway and crashed into another car. We all walked away, but had a lot of injuries not to mention losing work and losing money because of us."", ""I went to the ER on Friday night. I was having high level pain and I needed help immediately. They made me wait for almost 2 hours and still I couldn't see a doctor. On top of that most of the people I interacted gave me a stink eye didn't want to help at all. But again there were some exceptions and very nice young lady brought me water and that was incredibly polite. Overall I don't recommend this emergency care and I would suggest avoid this center because you don't want to be dealing with rude people when you're sick and in need of help."", ""lol, after seeing a psychiatrist here for less than a year, they are leaving MGH in favor of their own private practice, and I need to start ALL OVER with a new one.

Told me to follow up with my doctor. That may have worked except I am visiting from out of state and have no way home for 5 more days. There was also an elderly woman who came in about the same time.

Brigham & Women's Hospital,_wyUZ7ZRs1kRDrdQgU7N6w,-71.10749,42.336125,"[""No soap dispenser in two bathrooms in the ER when you've been here 4 days and go go to bathroom soap to wash your hands would be handy"", ""I was brought to The Brigham via Boston EMS. I arrived to the Emergency Department incredibly sick and in horrendous pain. The staff here has taken great care of me, with a few exceptions. The ED staff are top notch. If you have an emergency, this is the place to be. Boston is known for their world-renowned medical centers. If you have a complex case or illness, Boston is the place to be. Upon arrival, they luckily weren't super busy when I arrived. They had a bed open in the ED, so I wasn't stuck on a bed in the hallway. Shortly after arriving, the ED got totally slammed. People on beds in the hallway. The main issue is the lack of inpatient bed availability. Be aware that they do utilize shared rooms. If you have an immunocompromised person, they must have a single room to stay safe. Be aware you may wait days in the ED for a bed, let alone a single room. The ED staff were top-notch. Most hospitals struggle to even get an IV line going. No issue here. The staff is incredibly proficient and thorough. They order what is needed and heavily include the patient in those decisions. Not all places listen to the patient, in my experience. Meds were started and they took pain management seriously. It was great not being left to suffer in agonizing pain. They ensured I was kept as pain-free as possible. Bloodwork and imaging was done quickly, giving doctors the info needed quickly to make medical decisions. The providers are incredibly knowledgeable, competent, and kind. They throughly explained everything. I liked one of the specialities so much I made them my doctor on an outpatient basis. The staff truly goes above and beyond. Being immunocompromised, I had to wait in the ED for a day or two until a single room opened up. It does take time as they mainly have shared rooms. I was happy to wait and explained my reasoning to the doctors. They understood it but advised it may be a few days wait in the ED. I finally got taken up to a single room for inpatient care. The hospital is certainly in need of a total remodel. The ER appears to be recently remodeled. However, the rooms in the tower are just beyond tiny where you have to carefully move the IV pole around. The bathroom you can barely turn around. It is an older hospital that just needs a refresh to the inpatient floors. The floors are just totally worn out and in need of a remodel and full conversion to single patient rooms. I'd never share a room with a stranger. I couldn't handle the risk of getting sicker. I wouldn't want to have another person be in my room when I am sick and in pain. The hospital food is beyond inedible. It is run by Sodexo, so this comes as no surprise. The portions are also not enough for a grown adult. I'd bet the kids at Children's would still be hungry. And they don't allow you to order more than one entree. The menu is decent size, but the quality of the food is horrendous. I spent quite a bit at the on-site Panera due to this. Get rid of Sodexo and cook quality food. Sodexo is heavily processed and low quality. No taste to the food. The nurses on the inpatient floor are phenomenal. They are prompt when you press the call button. They are always on-time with the medications. If you are in pain, they always advocate for you and page the doctor. They're also top notch with IV placement, wound care, and so much more. Every nurse I had during my stay was phenomenal. The doctors and most of the residents were phenomenal and truly did everything to help me get well. Tests were ordered and done promptly. Infections were handled and treated with urgency. They are very thorough and know what they're doing. This is where complex patients come for care. They come for answers. They come to get their quality of life back. However, there were a few mishaps along the way. \xa0I am always brutally honest in my reviews. I had a few instances where Residents and General Medicine (Hospitalists) did not listen to plans put in place and caused me severe pain and set me back. I had an instance where a general medicine doctor told me to take something I have never taken- or he'd discharge me as sick as I was onto Francis street.If you are looking for answers, this is the place to go. Despite the bumps along the way, they are truly a top notch medical system. I'd walk into any Mass Gen/ Brigham hospital without concern. I know the world's best are there. I moved here for that very reason. Overall, a solid hospital. It just needs some improvements in a few areas to earn that Fifth Star."", ""This is a horrible hospital. All they care about is making a profit. Antony Masselli PA-C & David A Meguerdichian are the absolute worse. They had no concern for me after coming in the hospital for a concussion. After being the the hospital for two days he came into the room quoting the usual verse of basically kicking me out. Mind you I have insurance so that wasn't the case. After I screamed for him to get out he still proceeded to tell me I'm well and that I should be discharged. I told him he's not me and he doesn't know how I feel. All I need is just one more day but he didn't care and neither did the dimwit idiot David A. Meguerdichian.

The resident doctor (who was basically studying and getting practice) was the one who read the notes about my case. The surgeon came into the scheduled appointment without having read any notes about me and without bothering to look up the history of my case. I know this because I saw the resident filling him in and asked him whether he had read the notes. The surgeon responded, ""No: I\'d like to get to know a patient personally."" This type of doctor who is ""too good for information"" is not what I need.

I had a wonderful experience with doctor Andrew Wang and understood what was being performed.After the completion of the Arthrogram I was taken down to the MRI floor and was again greeted by a wonderful team who ensured my valuables were locked up and helped me understand what would be occurring.The team played wonderful music and was communicative during the entire process. This made the MRI seem to take less time and I felt much more comfortable. Upon completion of the MRI they were quick to get me out of the room and walked me through my next steps to review my results in the coming days.Upon returning to the lobby I was unfortunately unable to pay for my parking as I was parked in a different garage associated with the hospital. It would be nice if regardless of the Brigham Women's garage parked in if the ticketing & payment was consistent so I can just take care of it right when finishing up at the hospital and not upon returning to the 80 Francis street garage.

She responded ""Can you come in today?""I show up at my appointment, at which point I realized it was to see a NP in the general practice, NOT dermatology. I knew she was going to bill me, so I explained I didn\'t want to get billed, and she offered me a chance to leave the appointment, or she said I could keep the appointment and she could send a picture to dermatology.

A few important points:1) I had major abdominal surgery and they were going to do an epidural. I\'ve never had one and previous anesthesiologists declined to give me one because my blood pressure has a tendency to go low. I brought this up and they said ""Don\'t worry, if it goes too low we have ways to mitigate that and still give you medication."" It turns out the way they ""mitigate that"" is to tell you ""your blood pressure is too low"" and to leave you sitting in agony. In addition, the epidural was left in place for two days before anyone decided to do anything about my pain. So I had NO pain relief for TWO SOLID days because it didn\'t work after a major open abdominal surgery. Disgraceful. 2). I have a disability and complicated medical history, and prior to the pandemic my husband was ALWAYS allowed in the hospital with me due to this. It even says both on the CDC website that family members should be allowed to be together, but beyond that, the BETH ISRAEL website states you are allowed an escort up until you go in for your surgery. They absolutely REFUSED to allow my husband in, but I had to watch other family members have their support persons while I sat there terrified. Great. \xa0He should not have had to leave me at any point of my stay!3) \xa0While inpatient, the nurses treated my feeding tube HORRIBLY and claimed it was policy to do so ""because it is faster."" This is disgusting. \xa0Because most every nurse wouldn\'t listen to me and mixed all of my meds together (you\'re NOT supposed to even if it is ""faster,"" they literally clogged it on the first night and left it that way and told me I wasn\'t allowed to fix it myself. But THEY clogged it and THEY wouldn\'t fix it? Great! Treat tubes with respect and they don\'t clog. 4) I\'m an established feeding tube patient with complex medical issues who requires complex medications. They flat out stopped giving me several of my medicines and turned my water off (I require a lot of hydration due to a hereditary condition) and I am now dealing with complications from them not giving me my literal *water* and *medicine* I was prescribed before I got there. I begged but they ignored me and in the end I begged to leave just to not deal with how cruel this whole system was.5) Meds to beds is a COMPLETE SCAM don\'t agree to it under any circumstances tell them to send your meds to your normal pharmacy.6). They left a drain in me that\'s literally only draining 3-5ml a day. \xa0I asked them why and they told me ""The \'Boss\' wants it in."" So I have a drain that\'s not draining anything in me for the next MONTH?7) SO much more went wrong but honestly, this was by far my absolute worst hospital stay I have ever survived. Can\'t recommend. Terrible. What in the HECK? There was only ONE nurse I felt was trying actively to help me and I literally withstood a lot of physical and emotional abuse \xa0from many of them.

I would definitely recommend this hospital if you need knee replacement surgery.', 'This was the single most unprofessional experience I have ever had in the world of medicine, and certainly radiology which is generally pretty straightforward.I went to New England Baptist for an MRI of my thumbs. First of all, the scheduler on the phone told me to go to the wrong place for intake. The scheduler also told me to arrive early, because I would be taken ""first come first serve"" (which I have never heard before - isn\'t that why we make appointments?). So I arrived about 15 minutes early. I ended up waiting over an hour.During that hour, radiology repeatedly called the reception desk asking where I was. But nobody had done my intake yet, so they wouldn\'t let me go. There was maybe only one other patient in that room, so I\'m not sure what took them so long.Then I finally was escorted to radiology, where someone - the office manager, it seemed - yelled out to me from far behind the desk, leaning comfortably in his chair, asking me about how I injured my thumbs, and what kind of disease I had that would make them get hurt like that. This was in a large room that holds office staff and other patients. This is such a major HIPAA violation, and it honestly shocked me to have to shout to someone in a hospital about my diagnoses.Then they took me back to the MRI machine. I am a pretty thin person, but the slab was so small that I could barely fit on it. The technician instructed me to lie with my head face down in a pillow (suffocation, anyone?), and to stretch my arm out in front of me by contorting it over my head and then bending it toward my opposite side. They didn\'t even have a cradle to rest my head in so I could breathe. He said my only other option was to keep my head turned on the pillow for the full 90 minutes of the test. But part of my health condition is that I am not able to keep my head turned without dislocating my neck and potentially causing permanent nerve damage. The technician asked if I had any pain medication I could take; I explained that masking the problem would not stop the damage it would cause, which in this case could be quadriplegia. But he just didn\'t get it.""I don\'t understand,"" I said. ""You\'re an orthopedic hospital. Are you telling me you\'ve never had to do an MRI on someone who couldn\'t keep their neck turned for 90 minutes?""""No,"" he said.So we gave it a try with me lying on my side, in a position I had to figure out for myself. A few minutes in I had to press the emergency button (I\'ve had dozens of MRIs over the years, and this is the first time I ever had to do that), because of the excruciating pain I was in (which it took me about a week to recover from).So I left. The technician and office manager assured me that this was the only possible way to do the test; but I have since called Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, and the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, who said that of course they have patients who can\'t do that ""Superman"" pose, and that there are ways to get the images they need while lying on my back. They also correctly guessed that it was New England Baptist hospital that had screwed this up, which I suppose means they have a reputation for this sort of thing.If you need radiology, I cannot recommend enough that you go elsewhere.

We went to a pre-op class a couple weeks back at the hospital that I'd strongly recommend. While the two hours early in the morning can sound a bit daunting it was absolutely worth it. They went over what to expect during each step of the surgery and then some. The nurse and physical therapist went over assisted devices - a nice package of useful tools can be purchased for $45.The follow-up care is what has truly impressed me. The doctor called me immediately after the surgery was complete to let me know it was successful. A nurse called me later that day to let me know she was going to recovery. Nurses and PTs have already visited our home a couple times since she left the hospital on Sunday. Every staff member we've come across has been wonderful. She's already in less pain than she was before the surgery! Amazing!Minus one star because the coffee and food was really bad - even for hospital standards. And they somehow misplaced her shoes as we were leaving. They later found them but it wasn't really worth going back for and the drive into Mission Hill isn't really the nicest."", ""This place is the best spine center I've ever been.

Huge applaud to Lory again!!"", ""absolutely appalling treatment. my friend was complaining of knee pain and limping all throughout Saturday. Saturday night my friend called me, in tears from the tufts emergency room. I of course went and joined them in the ER. By some miracle my friend was seen relatively fast and taken into a room. Their knee was visibly swollen, red, and had a clear open cut on the side. when i touched their knee it was to the touch warm and felt mushy ( for lack of a better adjective). all they did there was X-ray my friends knee. once the x-ray came back clear and showed there was no break in their knee it was very apparent that nobody was taking the situation seriously and abundantly clear that they were chalking up my friends pain to dramatic young people. \xa0the mood from a total of three medical staff that was talking with my friend was overall very condescending and they very clearly did not take our concerns seriously. as i started their knee was VISIBLY swollen, physically warm, and my friend repeatedly stated how painful it was to move or bend it. even as a 18 with no medical training at ALL all symptoms were so clearly representative of a skin infection. they wrapped my friends knee and sent us on our way despite my friend's complaints of pain and the fact they could barley put pressure on their leg. they were instructed to rest, elevate it, ice it, and take Advil. all instructions were followed after returning back to the dorms. the next morning my friends knee was now hot to the touch, swollen to the size of a regulation sized softball, and they had a fever. they went back to the hospital that day and FINALLY received the diagnosis of a skin infection. it is now monday-three days since this entire ordeal even began and they are STILL in the hospital with a rollercoaster fever and unable to move their knee. i hate to say that this never would have gotten nearly as severe as it has if the emergency room doctors had simply stopped and genuinely listened the grocery store list of concerns that were presented to them Saturday night. i understand that we look like exactly what we are, two freshman in college, and i understand freshman in the city have a reputation that is less than stellar, and i also understand that the emergency room in a city is a very busy place, but i find little room for sympathy for doctors who blatantly ignore patients because of their own personal biases, especially as seeing that their idiocy has my friend still in pain and sick. overall if you are a college student and you are sick, do NOT go here unless you want to be talked down to and have your pain/concerns ignored.the most useful and helpful member of this staff was the security guard who helped me locate my friends room."", ""I got a missed call from TUFTS.

Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,HawMhlWeMpYTRs8-wkvw3w,-71.1081414,42.3374895,"['A well oiled machine is all I can say about the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. WOW! At the recommendation of my local oncologist, I flew to Boston to visit Dr. Burstein to weigh in on my treatment. Both he and the staff I encountered are simply magnificent. From the moment we entered the center, every part of the process was highly organized and the process in its entirety \xa0beyond efficient. Alyssa at the imaging center was so warm and helpful. I only had approx. 15 minutes until my appointment, but she managed to upload the most important CDs in the system so the doctor would have access during my visit. My appointment ran on time. The nurse Yasmina who took my vitals was simply lovely. Finally, Dr. Burstein is a phenomenal teacher. His ability to convey DNA in the simplest of terms is remarkable. What a blessing to be his patient! I left feeling very grateful I made the trip.I departed with a better understanding of the breast cancer that continues to invade my body. Specifically, the complexities the gene I possess presents with treatment along with a clearer understanding of which options are more favorable going forward. I highly recommend Dana-Farber Cancer Institute as well as Dr. Burstein. In the same token, I pray you never need to go.', ""I'm very, very familiar with Dana Farber now. I've been a patient there for the last twenty months. \xa0The upside to Dana Farber Cancer Institute is that it has the best cancer doctors on Earth. The downside is that its pharmacy is often overwhelmed, understaffed, \xa0and several hours behind .... And they don't communicate well with the rest of Dana Farber's staff. If you come to DFCI, you'll get the best treatment and access to the most cutting-edge clinical trials. But.... You will have very long treatment days and you will never get treatment on the weekends or in the evenings."", 'A Dana/Brigham patient that I shared a room with was sobbing and moaning throughout the night because doctors dod not adequately control her pain. This was not fair to her. For heavens sake, one of the most important considerations for compassionate care is the thoughtful, medically sound relief of pain. Why is there no in- hospital system providing effective pain relief!If you don\'t believe me, call the hospital and ask, ""My hospitalized Dana/Brigham relative is in agony. Is there a specific department that can address his pain?"" You will get radio silence because pain relief is not addressed per systematized protocol made available to all patients.If you happen to be ne of the ""lucky"" patients whose compassionate doctors prioritize pain management, you\'re golden. But for many, pain is dismissed.How is it possible that a hospital which prides itself on compassionate care has no systematized, organized response to severe pain -- with doctors specializing in pain relief playing a constant, central role in patient care?The example listed above? There should have been a team of doctors specializing in pain, relief entering that room, talking with patient, proposing solutions. The poor, hospitalized woman did not even have a translator -- and badly needed one. Rides on its reputation --not on actual quality. You want to do a good job? Do the work! The surgeon that I saw had not looked at any of the notes related to my case prior to the appt; His resident knew more about me than he did.Arrogance is the enemy of intellect. You earn your stripes when you learn your stripes -- by doing excellent work -- not simply by having the name, "" Harvard,"" included in your email address. Every Brigham/Dana doctor gets to have Harvard in their email address because it\'s part of the Partners contract with the university. But deep knowledge comes with \xa0reflection, research. \xa0There are some excellent doctors who work hard, prepare, show dedication. If you\'re not one of them, become one of them. Get yourself together, doctor, do the work. Earn a reputation by offering reflection, study, research -- not a pretentious \xa0label and a flimsy excuse as to why you and your colleagues offered conflicting info about my diagnosis and then dared to offer me life-altering treatment suggestions, never having even read my case. That\'s right, people: the doctor had not prepared at all for my visit to his office. It must be dang nice to know so much that you don\'t need actual information to inform your choices. Communication among doctors was extremely disconnected, with each dr. contradicting what the other had previously said . Sure - - dr. reviews on the website look great. \xa0However, did you know that those reviews are elicited from the institution, itself.... and this may inhibit patients from being honest.I know that there are some thoughtful, dedicated doctors in the hospital, and I was lucky to have several....and there were some excellent nurses, too. Excellent leadership is needed to raise the bar of consistence.Respond more swiftly to offer appointments.Meet as a team prior to meeting the patient -- bot after -- the status quo makes no sense.Re - organize so that you can meet the patient in a coordinated effort. And every doctor, nurse, administrator reading this should know: some of your patients are in agony, and for some of them, that agony is unaddressed . It is up to you - - those who work within \xa0the system - - to advocate for your patients-- NOT one at a time, but systemically, effectively. Do not let them wither in their rooms. Insist on a system that will offer compassionate care and address not only their medical needs... but the \xa0very real and predictable need for relief of pain. A system for pain management that includes doctors who specialize in pain management, and to which patients and their families have access must be developed.', ""Overrateddddd.

I am unable to do that. \xa0There are excellent doctors who are kind, knowledgeable and truly care about their patients. \xa0Then there are doctors who excel more at their research studies, and lack experience in patient contact or care. \xa0That was our experience along with a team of nurses who created barriers of communication, and other ongoing difficulties for one family member in particular. \xa0This was extremely stressful to him and his health. \xa0He now has a wonderful doctor, and is very grateful for that. \xa0From all that has happened, I cannot say every patient gets the best doctor or the same quality of care from DFCI and that saddens me beyond words. \xa0They are excellent at marketing for donations and funding, \xa0but it isn't what everyone thinks that it is.

On my most recent visit, I had an anaphylactic reaction to an infusion, and the nursing staff was over the top, fantastic. I thought to myself, they must go to the Simulation Lab, a lot, to practice their response to this life threatening emergency, often; ......then I learned, that their practice doesn\'t come from the Simulation Lab, but real, life experience. The team who cared for me, when I was at death\'s door, was fantastic.Because there is no Emergency Department in Dana Farber\'s outpatient buildings, that meant a trip, by ambulance, to Brigham and Women\'s Hospital Emergency Department, once I was stabilized (at Dana Farber). That might otherwise mean an opportunity for miscommunication between two different institutions, and a break in continuity of care, but, there wasn\'t; my care was seamless, and a testament to the people and systems in place at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and at Brigham and Women\'s Hospital.', ""Sadly I've become somewhat of a frequent flyer at this place.

When I went to the appointment it was with a resident, not my doctor, which I wasn't notified of. Told this student what was going on, then had to repeat it all to my pcp. Referred to orthopedics.Dr. Hector Osoria in orthopedics was particularly awful. Met with him for maybe 10 minutes where he told me I'll probably need surgery and then referred me to get an MRI. The MRI was denied by my insurance so Dr. Osoria needed to do a peer-to-peer. Took him SIX WEEKS to do it with no reason given as to WHY he wasn't doing it.

They were all talking in front of me, not sure if they were working for me or someone else. The nurse who checked my blood pressure was incredibly TERRIBLE.

I have also seen a prisoner wearing handcuffs with 2 officers on both sides of him coming into the building.Also, I think non of them are native English speakers.', 'I went to see an ENT at St.Elizabeth\'s in Brighton. The experience was smooth overall and the doctor was great. The training doctor that was there to obtain his fellowship was great as well. The staff were efficient and the hospital was fairly well run given the fact they are still reeling from COVID. However, I was not happy with the billing situation. I have a very good PPO plan through my workplace and called beforehand to make the appointment. I was told they accepted the insurance and went with that. I went for the appointment and was there for around 10 minutes. The office I went to was within the old portion of the hospital that they turned into specialty medical offices. The room I was in was clearly formerly used as a patient room on a medical floor and was converted to a treatment room. I saw the doctor and the training \'fellow\'. They performed a 20 second nasal endoscopy, no anesthetic at all. They did have me sign various forms just prior to the procedure. I will admit that I should have read them more clearly. I got out of the appointment with the whole thing taking 10-15 mins. Fast forward a few weeks and I get several bills. Not just from the medical office. From the office, the doctor, the training doctor, and the hospital itself. This doesn\'t even include the several bills that I had related to a CT scan I had, l that I realized would likely require some out of pocket payment. All totaled, the bills (just related to the 10 minute appointment) were over $1500. They got a bunch out of my insurance, what the insurance would allow. Then didn\'t accept that, they came for the rest from me. I have since reluctantly paid them, after speaking with my insurance. My advice, firstly, go to a different facility that fairly bills insurance and if needed, the patient, related to a speciality office visit and not surreptitiously bill for an ""outpatient surgical procedure"". Secondly, always make sure when seeing a specialist that they are within your network (specifically asking when booking the appointment) and also find out if they plan to bill as a regular office visit and not a procedure. My conclusion is this. They purposely built their office within a section of the hospital so that the hospital can bill separately for the same time and same space and same visit as the doctor(s) are billing for (essentially double billing or triple billing, but somehow legally). They also should be clearer that they will be billing for a procedure. Basically that opens the way for each entity to bill separately as it is beyond the scope of a \'specialty office visit\'. Also, I have never experienced another doctor or hospital that has continued to come after you after the insurance pays what is ""allowed"". But, I have also never had a PPO until recently, so that is my naivety. Bottom line: Go elsewhere and do your billing research beforehand. I knew Steward had a reputation for greed, but didn\'t think I would discover it firsthand.', 'The billing department for this hospital is the worst customer service experience I have ever had in my entire life. And I don\'t say that lightly. The hospital mistakenly charged me $600 more than I owe, and my insurance company has faxed them the explanation of benefits (EOB) multiple times (at least four confirmed times). Every time I call back and the hospital just says they need the EOB, my insurance faxes it again, and nothing happens. I have been dealing with this situation for over six months now and at this point I wish I\'d just let me appendix burst instead of dealing with the absolute incompetence of every single person I have spoken with at this hospital. My insurance company has repeatedly told them that they are overcharging me, and every time the billing department just says they will ""submit it for a review"" and nothing happens. I feel like I\'m living in the movie Groundhog Day because I get the same response time and time again and nothing happens, not to mention they refuse to put my account on hold even though they are the ones who insist they need ""up to 30 days"" to process. How long does it take to receive a single fax?? Unless you\'re literally bleeding out or so wealthy being overcharged doesn\'t matter to you, I would go literally ANYWHERE else for your health care.

The woman bulged her eyes at me, took the bunk with both hands and said, ""Why are you yelling, we only have one doctor for the whole department!""! I could not stand this, because I understood that in order to bring me a blanket, I didn\'t need a doctor, I automatically cursed from pain and cold, asked her name and once again asked to help me immediately.

I lay still for 40 minutes suffering from pain and cold. \xa0After that, a doctor came, five minutes later she invited a nurse, who gave me an injection and covered me with a warm blanket, the pain gradually began to subside. \xa0After a while, I managed to fall asleep, and then my wife arrived, and while we were waiting for the doctor to issue the documents for discharge, my wife approached the nurse in a black robe and asked her name, and was there a conflict between her and her husband, to which the nurse \xa0answered that her name was Carol and she had many witnesses that her husband was aggressive, cursed and threatened her!

The Belmont campus is older, stately, and beautiful - but the downside of beautiful old facilities is their inner workings. Some draftiness and plumbing issues plagued my mother's stay - it's not a modern hotel, for sure. Speaking up about these issues brought no immediate resolution, and so it was a side project to assure she got what she needed on this front.

Unfortunately, that is why we are here. MA Gen has set up the Yawkey Outpatient Care Center in such a way that they actually make your experience, well, pleasant. At least not dreadful. Lets start with drop off and parking. Drive up to the entrance and staff are available to help with wheelchairs if needed. Very helpful, polite staff from the start. You can also Valet park you car from here if you choose.If you are parking yourself, turn to the right just past the entrance and make a U-turn under the building. This underground lot goes down several levels and has an elevator to get back up to the lobby. Take your parking ticket with you!Elevators on the ground level are across from the information desk. When using the main entrance it's on your right. When using the elevators from the parking garage, it's on your left. Our oncologist is on the 9th floor. Once off the elevator, signs at ceiling level point the way to the different 'suites'. Like many of the other floors, this one has a wall of windows the full length of the hallway. Waiting rooms also have window walls looking onto the hall allowing natural light to flood the area making it bright and welcoming.Check in desks are by the entrance. The receptionist introduces themself and any other staff in the area. Each visit present your ID, verify your patient information and get a patient ID bracelet. This bracelet is checked at every step. Before seeing the doctor vitals and bloodwork are done. Again, the staff introduce themself and are chatty, personal and caring. There is always a bowl of candy and water in the waiting rooms.For treatment days, usually same day as doctors appointment, we move down to the 8th floor. After checking the patient ID at reception, we are escorted into the secure treatment area. The staff here do everything possible to be sure their patients and families are comfortable. Some of the treatment stations are in a bay with four large reclining seats and windows looking over the city. Other's are beds in private rooms for patients who can't sit up. Staff brings seats for family, offer juice, water, coffee and snacks, and get warmed blankets for chilly patients. Everyone on the floor are ready to help, no matter what their position, and are genuinely caring.As a general rule, treatments are offered with the same nurse each time. This creates comfort and a bond between staff and patient. Through the years we have met many staff members and all have been lovely. Some, downright delightful. Before every treatment two nurses verify the patient ID and medication they are to receive to be sure there are no mix-ups.Treatments can last all day. Lunch is provided for the patient: sandwich, soup, soda, chips and a sweet. For family there is a coffee shop and a small cafeteria on the first floor, walk over to the main hospital cafeteria or avail yourself to one of the many local restaurants.MA General has a variety of programs that offer help to patients for everyday needs like child care, house cleaning, yard work, laundry, meal delivery to name a few. Volunteer ambassadors are available to explain the program and get you started. There are also pamphlets available in waiting rooms and hallways. The Healing Garden is a quiet place to relax, unwind and reflect. For patients and family, it is on the 8th floor. Turn left off the elevator, then left at end of the hall and through the door straight ahead. It is a lovely indoor and outdoor space that 'gets you away' from the hospital.On the 2nd floor is a boutique selling wigs, prosthesis and other items that may benefit patients. The ground floor gift shop has a wide variety of items and you should definitely take a walk through.After your appointment, remember to pay for parking at the lobby cashier desk before returning to your car. Wheelchairs can be taken down the elevators, and please return them to the lobby if possible, or leave them by the elevator in the garage.The caring staff, snacks, sunny spaces and lots of other small touches add up to make these visits not just palatable, but pleasant. We can't thank the staff enough for their caring, thoughtful ways, taking not just the patient well being into consideration, but knowing the family also needs some TLC.""]",58

An hour before or an hour after scheduled med time is when you can receive your med. One nurse charged at a patient like she was going to swing on her the recovery advocate or specialist whatever her job title was had to hold the nurse back.....that was something I have never seen before in My life. The nurses aren't experienced in the detox addiction field at all and arguing with them to get your scheduled med is just totally inappropriate and needs to be looked into. The mirasol has ATS and CSS throw together along with people who come out of jail and it's court stipulated. That doesn't make sense to me. Patients should be seperated. It creates confusion, a big mess, arguing ect. Especially for ATS patients should be receiving their medications first before CSS or any other individuals who are on the floor.

Yes detox isn't supposed to be fun, that's not what I'm getting it , I'm just saying who ever is hiring these nurses maybe they are contracted through companies I don't know but they need to fix this. You have patients who are detoxing on medical watch thrown with css who are blasting music in the common areas it's just very uncomfortable place due to the nursing issue and ats css and individuals coming out of prison all thrown together , they really need to separate them.

Because I have little to no T7 left I'm getting a slight curvature at the top where my neck is. So, of frikken course I'm going to be in constant pain. Man I've never felt so validated in my life. \u200d he then gave me pain management options (cortisol injections) which may help short term. Down the road there is an option for surgery (rod and screws) but that's the last option. I left there feeling like I finally was HEARD.Anyone dealing with chronic pain or any other medical issue, my heart really goes out to you because this isn't easy.

It's always pleasant to go in for a visit (as pleasant as a doctor's appointment can be), whether it's planned or unplanned. The front desk is constantly busy and it can take a short wait before they get to you, but don't mistake that for rudeness. Dr. Lytle has appointments as early as 7am, which means you don't have to be late for work or skip out early in the middle of the day. I've never had to wait months for an appointment. Even though it's nearly impossible to book her on a last minute basis if you get sick (which isn't different from any other doctor's office), there's always a NP available to see you w/in the next day or two of calling.Dr. Lytle shows genuine care and interest in her patient's health and well being. She always asks questions and actually takes time to listen, which is rare form these days. She also prides herself on being on time and doesn't like her patients to wait. She'll apologize if she's late. It's the little things that matter. =)I've also seen NP Meghan a few times as well when I've been sick, and she's great. She's so personable, friendly, and easy to talk to. She really takes her time to talk to you to understand what's going on. I've never ever felt rushed to get out the door with her.I can't say anything but praises for MCA. Even though I don't work in the city anymore, it's well worth the hassle of parking, T-ing, or fighting the peak hour crowd to see a doctor who actually cares about me!"", ""I've been seeing Dr Lytle for over 5 years after a long wait to get into her practice. She is simply the best health care provider that I've had. She has a terrific bedside manner and is extremely thorough.

I\'m healthy, so fortunately only ever needed to go for physicals. First visit was fine. But between visits they switched systems and ""lost"" my information.

Staff was so rude and treated me like I had made a mistake and had never been there before - even after I gave them all of the info from my visit. Finally a supervisor cleared it up. Then the billing mess. Literally had all of the same procedures done from one physical to the next with ZERO changes to my health, but somehow I received a bill for $700 for the second one.

I ended up getting a call back 4 days later, and the nurse who I spoke with was lovely, but they insisted I come in for a well visit first. They then scheduled in mid February (their earliest availability being almost 4 months out). That kind of sucked but I tolerated it, because I do like getting my primary care here. About 2 weeks before my visit I received a voicemail that my visit had been cancelled because of a scheduling issue. They indicated I should cal back to reschedule. I did call back, and reschedule for the following week. This next bit is a true display of laughable incompetence. Following that reschedule, I got ANOTHER voicemail from the office saying they're no longer accepting new patients, and because I haven't been seen in 2 years I was considered new. I implored that I'd been trying to get a visit for 3+ months and that would have been within 2 years of my last visit. They said, I was considered a new Laurent regardless, so I wouldn't be receiving a visit.By this point i did some self reflection and realized: the stress, work/travel re-scheduling, and overall sever frustration I endured trying to get a primary care visit is just not worth it for me."", 'I\'ve come twice.

But the pros outweighs the con and this place is highly recommended."", 'As a new patient, I scheduled a routine physical exam with Doctor Lytle. I was never seen by her and instead of being given a physical routine I was told that I first had to have a consultation visit. I requested to still have my PAP and blood work done because I knew my insurance did not cover unplanned visits to the doctor. I was refused and instead had to schedule a second visit to have those things done. As a result I was billed $150 for the unplanned doctor visit. When I called to appeal, I was told that they stand behind their billing codes, and would not resubmit the visit as preventative. I specifically requested to have these routine things done during my first visit and was denied AND told that they did it this way so that the billing goes through properly.

Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Needham,NKtMWDAPtqgrJ49CcjnJNw,-71.236662,42.277285,"[""This is my local ER if my spouse or I need care after-hours. I like the fact that it's in the BI system, so they can see records (with some difficulty/work-arounds) from the main BI hospital as well as outpatient clinics, labs, and urgent care centers. I recently went here late on a weeknight after urgent care had closed, because I cut my hand with kitchen shears. The check-in process was quick, the waiting room was almost empty, and I got into a room quickly. It was very quiet, so I imagine it was a slow night.The nurses and techs were really nice; the gentleman who cleaned the wound--worst pain of my life, literally--was sympathetic and caring.The doctor was pretty straight-forward, and answered my questions when I asked them (I know to advocate for myself), but there wasn't as much forthcoming information as I would have liked. For example, would bruising be normal? Swelling? Pain? It was only 3-4 stitches but it was a deep cut so I had all of that, and wasn't sure if it was normal.I also got contradictory information in the ER vs. the urgent care center [also BIDMC] where I got the stitches taken out, but I think that's more the fault of the urgent care center. The discussion was around whether to keep the wound covered until the stitches came out: the ER nurse said to cover it when possible to keep out infection and to minimize scarring; the urgent care nurse who took out the stitches 10 days later said I shouldn't have done that. [Note: I'm not docking the ER for this, because based on my research/talking to other doctors, what I did was perfectly fine. There were also other things that the urgent care didn't do right, so I'm leaning in favor of the ER. In fact, 1 month later, it's healing quite nicely with a smaller scar than had I followed the urgent care instructions.]No billing issues.I'd 100% go back again if I needed something simple done.

Fenway Health,m7Y37KvgvoEG1s2yslOC4Q,-71.0989879,42.3440775,"[""I've been a patient in the South End office since the last week of 2014. My PCP was a young man named Dr Shi for the 1st year before he moved to SF. I have 7 herniated discs, 3 vertebrae compression fracture, no cartilage in my shoulders, wrists, or thumbs due to degenerative joint disease, and my mobility is extremely limited. Just getting from bed to the bathroom to the living room is a challenge every day. I am disabled, but was turned down for disability multiple times. That is not Fenway's fault. My PCP since has been a Dr named Ethan Brackett. With my sister's help, I started driving for Uber, then Grubhub, and now Lyft to support myself, but due to such limited mobility, I cannot work full-time. My physical therapy was managed poorly for almost a year and a half before I just stopped going. Getting there was too physically demanding for me and there seemed no chance at receiving help any other way.My pain has been managed with cyclobenzaprine (flexerall) which does not help me, does not increase mobility either. It only causes me to be too tired to drive, so I don't take it regularly. I was given Gabapentin which made me physically ill and didn't increase my mobility nor did it decrease my pain levels. The third medicine prescribed was Tramadol, which seems to be the lowest level of an opiate. Tramadol doesn't negate pain, but it does improve my mobility by about 5 to 10%, which is enough for me to get out of the house. My pain level is at a level 10 constantly, in every moment, which numerous shots of adrenaline due to constant shots of pain able to take a normal person to the ground. Doing basics like getting dressed, putting on and taking off clothes, leaving the house, and running even the most basic errands takes energy out of me to the point of not being able to move at some point during the day. Some days, I never make it out of the house. Also, I cannot sleep as moving at all shoots pain out of my shoulders, and the increased levels of adrenaline make it difficult to relax my mind and body enough to sleep. I've managed my pain via meditation for years, averaging less than 2 pills per day for over 7 years. However, in the last 6 months or so, I have taken more tramadol to get me to be able to move to sustain even the lowest levels of self-sustainability. I have asked for a stronger medication countless times, and the only answer I get is to take gabapentin, which makes me sick. The only sense I get is a sense of self-preservation and cover their own ass for Dr Brackett, Dr Shi previously, and the recent classless, condescending, combative Dr. Jatinder Gill of the Arnold Warfield Pain Center.Because of my age and ability to earn in the past, it seems I qualify for nothing that can help me, and despite referring me to an advocate, and a financial services advocate, these people have only emailed lists I could readily find on the internet. Are there any doctors out there who actually care about the patient's best interest instead of just pawning the patient off of on someone else once their pain level reaches an insane level which makes it difficult to live? About calling and communicating with Doctor's through the patient portal, about making appointments and connecting different people with information throughout my care, Fenway South End has been good. The people there may be overwhelmed, but they take care of me and my past requests as soon as they can. They do so in a pleasant manner. They are really smiley, but I understand the stress they are under, so I am patient and kind and appreciate all of their hard work. This is why I rated Fenway South End a 3 star review. They are not horrible, but I certainly don't feel I have a doctor who is really ready to help me. I feel like I am getting a big stiff arm as long as I am in pain and as long as I am not completely incapacitated."", ""This place is a nightmare. You never get your meds refilled on time, when you speak up they blame it on you, and they have a backlog on their end of prior authorizations for at least two weeks- because they are short staffed.

As if being placed off my meds d/t them dropping the ball wasn't bad enough- each month after there had been an issue (I even got the wrong medication refill...). I am seeking a different practice at the moment.

They've prescribed me discontinued medications, not followed up after lab work results are in as they are supposed to and I've encountered rude and unhelpful employees. I am sympathetic that it is a difficult time to be in medicine, but the incompetence and lack of empathy I've encountered is appalling.

My next call is to Atrius. I do hope that Fenway cleans house in the senior management office, and hires superior talent that can fix the org, but I'm assuming that's years off.

Finally met that nurse in June... who couldn\'t believe I waited since November. Things changed in 7 months and it wasn\'t particularly helpful :/More interestingly, also in May I got a call to schedule therapy and was assigned a therapist. That was so odd... after they said they\'re not going to schedule anything. My first appointment was supposed to be today, 6/3. I didn\'t receive any ""please confirm appointment"" texts and checked online... only to find that my appointment was gone.I gave behavioral health a call and they said ""provider cancelled your appointment because you were reassigned to someone else"". I did not receive any communication from fenway health about this. They could not schedule an appointment with that someone else either and told me to wait for that new therapist to call me. The person on the line hung up the phone as soon as I said ""ummm, ok"" to what she told me.This is way too careless for a place that routinely deals with a very sensitive population (e.g. 42% of trans individuals attempted suicide). My advice is to stay away from these people.UPDATE: they\'re now claiming they cancelled my appointment because my chart mentioned that back in November I had a therapist someplace else. I\'m told they have internal policy to refuse scheduling therapy appointments if you have any therapy appointments someplace else.

My partner is experiencing pain from a tooth that needs a root canal. He had received a filling earlier today and unfortunately, the dental student did not secure a prescription for pain medication due to thinking a filling would solve the issue. Since he was seen by a dental student and due to the day/time they were unable to have an overseeing dentist prescribe him pain medication. He decided to call HUHS to see whether his PCP or his staff could help him with medication until a root canal on Monday. After speaking with someone on the phone, the person said they did not know what to do for him, but they said he could come down if he was close by and wanted to discuss it with a Nurse Practitioner. He went in person and ultimately nothing could be done because his PCP was not in. It would have been much preferred to hear that over the phone as opposed to walking (In pain) to the Smith Campus Center. That itself could have been a misunderstanding but how he was treated when arrived there is the real problem. The front desk staff were rude and dismissive from the moment he started speaking to them. The man at the front desk denied he had coverage (rudely, cutting my partner off...) and questioned everything my partner said. My partner presented his card and then said his PCP\'s name and that he had been there before, the man responded ""Well that\'s impossible."" Someone else then looked him up and found him, but as he was walking to see the NP they shouted out ""No wait you don\'t have coverage!"" To then check again and confirm he did. What is going on at HUHS that they can\'t even check someone in who has been there, and if the system was having issues then that is not their fault, but how they treated my partner is again the issue. The NP then told him that they did not have the authority to prescribe him anything. This, again, could have been said clearly and directly over the phone to not waste his or anyone\'s time but again would not be a huge issue if not for the interactions at the front desk. My partner was in pain and thought he would receive at least basic level of human decency in his interactions with HUHS staff. He was treated like he was a criminal walking off the street demanding drugs. He has seen his PCP there. This is HIS healthcare provider. They were asking him whether he was a ""summer school student""...do they really not know how to use their own system, and that itself is understandable because systems change/new staff/systems act wonky... but being rude and dismissive is not. I have heard others\' stories of bad experiences at HUHS (including my partner having previously been given wrong information in getting blood work done) and now it is just too much. If you are a staff member, then choose another insurance option. I had been a graduate student at Harvard before becoming an admin and thought it easier to stay. But I deeply regret that decision after what my partner experienced.', 'This review is for all of the nonsense that I have personally had to deal with as a student here. \xa0I am honestly fed up with the general attitude here. \xa0Giving it 2 stars because of neutral to good experiences I\'ve had with some members of staff.Freshman year: I go to my primary care doctor. \xa0I tell him I have these horrible headaches. \xa0He literally tells me to just get sleep. \xa0Um. \xa0Ok. \xa0Sophomore year: I have this massive 2nd degree burn. \xa0I go to urgent care, literally no patients waiting there. \xa0I have to wait an excruciatingly long time before I get treated. \xa0When the doctor is ready to see me, she says, ""Oh we have patients staying overnight who have more urgent concerns than yours."" \xa0No apology. \xa0To top it off, the primary treatment I am given is this topical cream that, after a quick google, I find out, ""prolongs healing time"" and shows no ""real indications of efficacy."" \xa0I get by on codeine. \xa0Junior year: I go to an urgent care having filled out a survey. \xa0My thyroid might actually be infected. \xa0A doctor sees me, and she tells me, ""Oh, we don\'t treat thyroid issues in urgent care. \xa0It\'s not urgent. \xa0You have to go see primary care."" I guess I would have really appreciated it if they had just emailed me to not show up rather than making me show up and wasting my time.The next day, I phone in to try to schedule a primary care appointment. \xa0She asked me why I didn\'t call yesterday, and I told her that I had a lot of work I was trying to take care of. \xa0She literally scoffed at me. \xa0She also was both extremely unhelpful and condescending when I asked her about the steps I would need to take to treat thyroid issues and . . . I\'m fairly certain that she doesn\'t understand the difference between getting the ok for a thyroid screen and actually getting a screen. \xa0She honestly didn\'t seem to know what she was doing in general. \xa0It goes without saying that it is extremely frustrating to talk to someone who is both illogical and also arrogant about it. \xa0Never in my life have I dealt with such terrible service from health staff.Point being, HUHS, step up your game. \xa0We as students go to you to be treated, not aggravated.', 'I\'m so torn. I would give HUHS 5 stars for their doctors, but negative stars for 1 receptionist. I always have a great visit with doctors and the NP\'s- especially dermatology (Dr. Cummins is so great!). However, there was one receptionist, Susan, in Specialty Services who is HORRENDOUS. I mean... do NOT ask her any questions, no matter how legit and valid they are because she will bite your head off, and then some. Amazingly horrible customer service- I left with tears in my eyes because she made me feel oh-so stupid and I was so not prepared to be attacked by a massive jerk. This leads me to the 3-star review because I cannot get over the insane hostility.In my opinion, Specialty Services needs to learn to stick-up for their customers and kick this woman out (at least put her in the back where she never interacts with humans). Apparently being overly hostile towards me just wasn\'t enough for her ego, so Susan was condescending and short with everyone else that entered for eye-care. Anybody who had questions was ridiculed until they would just walk away in bewilderment. Sounds like Susan loves people and her job, right? Hah. It\'s scary that she actually treats everybody liek this and nobody cares to tell her to stop! Speaking of that, when I mentioned how disrespected, belittled and humiliated I felt to another receptionist she simply said ""Yahhh, sorry."" and passed me tissues. I later heard her gossiping with Susan about me, to which she said ""Don\'t worry, it doesn\'t even matter"" !?!?! Um... what?! Great customer care, people. I was so upset that I couldn\'t even tell the doctor what had happened- I literally thought I would cry. I may sound like a huge baby, but really, I am just a normal human who doesn\'t care to be attacked for no reason. We\'re all entitled to ask questions about the cost breakdowns, aren\'t we? No need for Susan to be defensive (newsflash lady, it isn\'t your personal money) and freak out on me. Just simply explain the breakdown like A-B-C. So, in conclusion, receptionist Susan in Specialty Services is an asshole (sorry, I seriously have no other words to describe her) and gets negative stars. Never talking to that evil queen again. However, I will continue to get my eye exams, dermatology and basic health exams here because it is convenient and I enjoy who takes care of me, so 5 stars to the Doctors and NP\'s.', ""I had an awesome experience with Dr. Daniel Zandman. He was extremely professional throughout the encounter with a condition I was terribly embarrassed about, and more importantly, prescribed me something that actually works!On the other hand, I was less than enthused with Dr. Lisa Barna, who referred me to Dr. Zandman. I had a common problem that wasn't getting better after months of trying home remedies. I know she's not an expert with my issue but I wanted a professional opinion on whether I had what I thought I had. She did the quickest exam ever and confirmed my self diagnosis. Well, it turned out to be wrong (maybe because she looked for a grand total of 5 seconds), as my 4th year med school friend guessed and Dr Zandman later confirmed. I didn't feel like she wanted to listen to or help me."", 'This review is for the massage services portion of HUHS. (Note: I think most services are restricted to students, faculty, and staff, so apologies to all those out there who can\'t access HUHS!)I fell in love with HUHS massages when I went to free health tent that HUHS was holding a couple years ago. I waited patiently in line to get a free 10 minute massage, and found out I had a knot (at this point, I didn\'t even know what this meant.) In 10 minutes, I felt SO much more balanced and calm than I had throughout the 20-some years of my life before that.UHS offers 10-minute chair massages 3 days a week (MWF) for $12/10 minutes. It\'s not the cheapest: I can name a few places that offer massages $1/minute, even at the low ten minute mark. But it\'s very professional and tips are not allowed, so I think it all breaks even. Warning on the 10-minute massages: their quality varies a LOT. I\'ve had ""wow, I\'m so glad I did this"" feelings to ""wait, I just spent how much for that?"" I had my first one hour massage here a month ago, and let me tell you, it surprised me how wonderful it was. I randomly chose a masseuse and she was AWESOME. I didn\'t think it was overly relaxing during the process, but days after I felt like I might never need another massage again, which I think is the real point of massages - to ""heal"" you, not to make you crave more and more (and trust me, I\'m addicted to massages, so this feeling is not easy to come by). It\'s cheap, too, at $60/hr, with the no-tipping policy. Sometimes you can stumble upon good deals elsewhere, but this is a good, steady staple for those who want professional/medical treatment and are somehow affiliated with Harvard.', ""(I'm comparing this to other university health services that I've had experience with)Great service. Just got a free flu shot, and I've had to work w/ HUHS for start-of-school immunizations, etc. All in all, they prepare well, have plenty of people on hand to work with crowds. When you have an appointment, they docs and NPs are super friendly, offering relevant advice. Hard to see anywhere they could improve. Keep it up!"", ""I'm still a huge fan of general care at HUHS, as well as most of the specialists, but the OB-GYN department needs a few lessons in customer care and bedside manner. \xa0I've had less than satisfying experiences with two doctors, a nurse practitioner, and a receptionist over there. \xa0I'm sure it's fine if you know exactly what you're in for or what you want, but God forbid you have any questions...Unfortunately, this type of care is integral enough to my general healthcare that I'm going to have to take away one star. \xa0Too bad."", 'Great service for a health care clinic! Conveniently located downstairs from my office. Really easy to talk to a Human being, and not to mention affordable!!!i would give it TEN starts if i could!', ""I've been here so many times and for so many services over the last decade that my review is for my collective experience and not one experience in general. Here is a summary of some of the services I've taken advantage of:1) Dental Service - the best experience I've had. Ever. People normally dread the dentist, but I love mine. My hygienist here, Marie, is the bomb diggity. I absolutely love and adore her. She makes cleanings incredibly pleasant! In addition to preventative services, they also offer a wide range of dental services ranging from periodontology (gums), to teeth whitening to oral surgery (wisdom teeth removal), to general dentistry, etc. The only thing I don't know if they do is not is orthodonture (I'm pretty sure they don't).2) Vision - There are a few optometrists working here, and I've seen two of them. Most recently, with Dr. Fuhrman. She is very matter-of-fact, but thorough. Eye care is serious business to her! Appointments aren't too hard to get. the worst part is waiting to be called at your appointment. I don't think I've ever been seen exactly at my appointment time. They are always running behind.3) Obstetrics/Gynecology - I was here last year when I was pregnant. The OB/Gyn specialists here are a hidden gem. Seriously, they are top of the line. The doctors here are actually part of a practice in Chestnut Hill, but all the doctors rotate one day a week here in this clinic. They are all INCREDIBLE. I made it a point to have an appointment with at least each doctor, since you end up delivering with whomever is on call, and it could be any of them. I liked them all. A LOT. So incredibly knowledgeable and I was never once worried about my health or my baby's. The NP here, Fran, is also amazing. She's been delivering babies for the last 30 years and knows her stuff (probably more than some of the doctors!). The in-house nurse, Harriet, is easily accessible, even via phone and email. She is prompt in getting back to you, and if something unexpected comes up, she can usually squeeze you in that day with a doctor or nurse. If you use this practice here, you end up delivering at Brigham & Women's, which has one of the BEST L&D/Maternity wards in the *country*. Boo-yah!4) Pediatrics - My daughter is in good hands here. We see Carole Browne, who is actually a NP here, but she is as good and knowledgeable as any pediatrician I've ever met. She genuinely loves and cares about her patients (and their parents too!). We wouldn't go anywhere else.5) Adult Primary Care - it seems like ages since I've seen my PCP, but I do go annually and have never had an issue with them. I book my appointment months in advance, and they always go smoothly. Again, very knowledgeable doctors and staff.6) Laboratory Services - located in the basement here. You go here for bloodwork, x-rays, etc. It's great that it's located in the same building, and not too far away. Results usually take a few days, since the blood is shipped off-site. But, the staff is prompt and very nice. Keep in mind that even though this looks like a rinky-dink little medical operation, it is a full-fledged mini-hospital. It is not unusual here for the doctors to teach at the Medical School, have their own practices, or practice at a Harvard-affiliated hospital (Children's, BWH, MGH, etc.). You are getting world-class medical knowledge and care in a smaller, more intimate setting. Plus, if you are a HUGHP member, you get three hours of free parking in the downstairs garage with validation. How do you possibly give that less than 5 stars?""]",51
CHA Somerville Campus,GjIK68akUEAfyD3c55JETg,-71.1088964,42.3904817,"['UPDATE - I\'m updating this review to reflect the follow-up I received from the hospital. I definitely didn\'t want to give the whole operation a bad review based on 1 parking attendant. Patient Relations got in touch with me a few hours after I left them a message and showed a genuine concern and understanding for my situation. I feel much better after speaking with them and I am very happy with how they handled my complaint. Original Post:This review is for the hospital parking. I\'ve been going to his hospital for three years now, but I used to live down the street so I never had to use their parking lot before. AVOID USING THEIR LOT IF YOU CAN. The parking attendant charged me $5 for parking there for an hour - but I was only there for 50 minutes. (They\'re only supposed to charge $2 for an hour or less). He was very aggressive and I ended up crying because his approach was very intimidating. I arrived at 8:05 and left at 8:55 - he wasn\'t at the lot at 8:05, so I can only assume he was covering for being late to work by printing a false ticket. (Everyone\'s late for work, but you don\'t have to treat people so terribly...) I also think he may have jacked up the price because he thought I was trying to leave without paying - I told him, I\'m *happy* to pay for parking, but not when I\'m being scammed.He kept using the phrase ""I\'m not lying to you"", maybe 2 or 3 times. If he wasn\'t making me late for work, I would have asked to look at the security footage. It was very weird.The parking would get 0 stars if I could, it was a very upsetting experience to be intimidated and cheated, especially after a doctor\'s appointment. (For those of you thinking, it\'s just $3 extra - I\'m fine paying $5 for parking, when that\'s what I\'m supposed to be paying, and when the parking attendant doesn\'t make me cry.)I called their patient relations and left a message. I\'ll update the review if I hear back from them.(PS - the hospital itself is perfectly nice and Dr. Bansen is great!)', ""Wish i could do zero stars ! Absolutely terrible service and just terrible people. They don't care about anything you have to say ! They don't even treat you to their full potential! Just terrible service all around"", ""The nurses here are literally the most disgusting vile people ever. I've been here twice and it's like pulling teeth to get these people to their job. It's like they just want to sit around and get paid to do nothing. The nurses here are the least empathetic people working in health care."", ""I wish there was a negative star. Went here after dislocating my finger, waited almost two hours for an X-Ray followed by a 10 minute consultation with the in-house doctor who couldn't answer any question with confidence and was billed over half a grand. The thing that made me so mad was the $207 charge to see that incompetent doctor because although this place claimed to be an urgent care, it's really a hospital and thus you're charged a fee for the first visit. It is bizarre. Other urgent cares in the area charge a fixed fee under $200 for the whole ordeal but are usually more packed and busy (go figure). To make matter worse, they wouldn't respond any of my inquiries after the visit and getting a copy of my x-ray was a very big hassle."", ""Dave Adamo in Gastro was unbelievably rude when I went in for an endoscopy. I was told in a pre op call that my procedure would take around 2 hours, including prep and recovery. When Dave asked me who was going to pick me up and at what time I told him that my sister was and that she'd be there in around 2 hours or so since she was coming from Hingham. He immediately got upset and said that was too late and he didn't want to stay late so my procedure may be cancelled. I was SO pissed. He acted like Hingham was on the moon or something. After his mini freakout he went away to talk to someone, but I could hear them talking about me. I had enough and told them to stop whispering about me and that it was not my fault that the pre op call gave me the wrong timeframe. Eventually, it was squared away, but Dave continued with his attitude. I told the other nurse that was with me that I didn't want him near me. After I ignored him he eventually got the hint and left with a huff. After my procedure when I woke up he wasn't even there. So why try to cancel it because you don't want to possibly stay late when you're leaving anyways!? I'll never have anymore care done at that location and if you get Dave Adamo ask for a different nurse."", ""This is a review of the relatively new urgent care department of the hospital. \xa0Wow, this place is the best-kept secret of Somerville! \xa0I've visited 3 times in the past 3 months (rough year!) and I've never waited longer than 20 minutes to be seen. \xa0I'm sure it's luck of the draw, but good luck three times in a row? Not bad. \xa0The receptionists have always been pleasant, and always have a good supply of hand sanitizer. \xa0I've liked every nurse I've encountered, most making nice small talk that put me at ease, and some with a fun sense of humor! I really like that as part of the regular medical questions, they ask if you're feeling safe at home and in your relationships. \xa0The doctors have been brisk but thorough, and I've been able to ask any lingering questions and get thoughtful/honest answers. \xa0They don't stay and chat but it's an urgent care, not speed dating, who cares!

Nothing, no communication. I had to call to find out what the hell was happening- Prescription refills: Even standard refills take FOREVER to refill. Plan on 5 days with zero communication - Prescriptions I've been on over 20 yrs were summarily denied and I was never notified that it had been denied- I became concerned about the results of wellness test - they dismissed it and I needed to keep pushing for them to take anything seriously. - They rarely call you back, even if they need to provide you with critical information or lab results- Hold times - it can be worse than the airlines with 30+ minutes - on hold only to be transferred when they pick up- Don't bother calling near their opening time - they sometimes don't answering phones until about 20 minutes after openingI'm now in the process of searching for another PCP.

Is it alright for her to sit there with a needle in her arm for no reason? Stayed for over three hours which is not the problem if we had gotten some information to hopefully better her condition. We were visited by atleast five different persons who worked there, who would come check blood pressure, temperature and leave without saying anything. Were unprofessional with dirty looks and had no empathy for my wife, like they had never been sick before in their lives. Finally almost when leaving Rujeert manages to pull the IV needle out of my wifes arm aggressively after 15/20mins after I asked three different people and again when I say ""Excuse me"" to ask her to do it I get a snarky remark. There are literally 2 other patients other than my wife being constantly checked on every few mins right next to us but us nothing. Great to know I have to pay for that BS treatment.

Massachusetts General Hospital West,bMssyEEXqsswUVwwPJ7Oug,-71.2636,42.39591,"[""The hospital itself is good. The building is clean and well maintained, and there's adequate staffing. A family member received care here, and everything was beyond our expectations. The garage, however, is a hot mess. We entered the garage from the street entrance to go left to the green building. Then you find you're actually at the blue building entrance. This requires an elevator to the 4th floor then a bridge to the green building on foot, then to whichever floor in that building. Unfortunately, upon entering the blue building from the parking lot, there are no signs to inform you. We happened to see a janitor and asked him how to get to the green building. Wouldn't it make more sense to allow you to park near the green building? Too confusing."", 'This review is of MGH WEST, also known as Massachusetts General Hospital WEST, at 40 Second Avenue, Waltham. MGH West is a spacious bank of two, multi-story buildings that include doctor\'s offices, specialty clinics, radiology and other related services, and Ambulatory Surgery Center (Same Day Surgery Center). There are no in-patient beds at MGH West, and there is no Emergency Department or Urgent Care Center at MGH West. So, best you not be confused.Also best that you know in advance of your arrival by car, which building you are going to, the BLUE Building or the GREEN Building, as each has their own indoor parking lot. It\'s possible to cross between buildings, in an indoor pedestrian tunnel, but that\'s a bit of a nuisance, so ideally, best you know prior to your arrival, to park in the Blue Building garage or the Green Building garage. Parking is free (I should say factored into the costs of your care, and not subject to an additional charge).I\'m thinking that it\'s been 20 years since I was last at MGH WEST, and I was struck, on this visit, how many primary care and specialty services MGH now has at MGH West, and in the Boston West suburbs. What a privilege for someone who lives west of Boston, who does not want to drive to the main MGH campus in Boston, for their care, to be able to see the same MGH Physician at MGH West, as at MGH Boston. It is a shame to hear on Boston TV and radio how UMASS Memorial Medical, LifeSpan, and Shields MRI are doing all that they can to prevent MGH from building similar facilities to MGH West in Westborough, Westwood, and Woburn, and bringing WORLD-CLASS MGH CARE to these areas of Massachusetts.My visit, today, to MGH West was for an MRI with IV contrast. The admissions process was quick, professional, and efficient. I was initially greeted by one Radiology Technologist, that quickly turned into a three Radiology Technologist effort, and these three Radiology Technologists worked together, like you\'d expect of sophisticated, highly talented, unbelievably well synchronized, professional and compassionate health care professionals. I doubt that you\'d find this level of care anywhere else in the western suburbs, it struck me as Signature MGH World Class Care.Once my procedure was done, I was greeted by a fond farewell, and I was ready to move on. 30 minutes of MRI banging was enough for me (thank God for ear plugs!).I don\'t know where the people at UMASS Memorial, LifeSpan, and Shields MRI get the audacity to try to sway Massachusetts government officials, under their pseudonym, ""Coalition to Protect Community Care,"" to prevent MassGeneral Brigham from their plan to expand to Westborough, Westwood, and Woburn. This is the world of self-interests that we live in, like those of UMASS Memorial, LifeSpan, and Shields, hidden behind the façade of the ""Coalition to Protect Community Care."" Good Lord.', 'This is a MGH West - a new and rather excellent outpatient facility. To begin with, there is a free garage parking! They have a wide range of specialities, including podiatry, cardiology, a cancer center, dermatology, pediatrics, neurology, primary care, OT and PT. It\'s easier to obtain an appointment there than in MGH\'s downtown location. Consequently if you live in a western or northwestern suburb, it\'s your best bet for MGH care.The front line receptionist staff are happier and more patient orientated than the main downtown hospital. I speculate that this ""happy"" atmosphere even permeates medical appointments. It certainly has been my experience that physicians seemed more relaxed. The doctors often split their time with MGH downtown. They have an in building eatery. There \xa0is a podiatry speciality store selling lots of cool speciality products for your feet. The building is surprisingly aesthetically pleasing. It is appointed with wide and spacious hallways and this makes it particularly wheelchair friendly. You can relax in comfortable armchairs in a sunswept atrium. So it\'s ideal if you are accompanying a friend or family member for a medical procedure. (Parts of it remind me a a pleasant hotel lobby.)There is easy and close access to the highway - another plus for people with disabilities. Indeed the entire experience there is disability friendly!

So finally,they come back to the room and tell us she had a broken L2 ok after her one test in almost 7 hrs and now we're told this and you still have yet to give her any pain meds besides administering only Tylenol and a shot of Tramadol and it isn't even helping her and now you know she has a broken L2 and you're still not going to give her any pain meds are you kidding me? I am so upset to have to sit there and watch my mom whos 70 yrs old in that much pain and this hospital isn't doing anything to help her has me Irate.

The gauze was soaked in blood and I alerted another nurse, she removed the old gauze and wrapped the wound with new gauze, no cleaning of the wound at all, never spoke to me. The doctor comes in, takes a very brief look at the cut and proceeds to tell me that all I need to do is keep the wound clean and replace the bandages every 3 hours, elevate the foot and take aspirin for the pain, then discharges me. I addressed that the wound looked too deep and the constant bleeding was a concern, I was then told if I didn't like their advice I should go somewhere else.

It really says something when the most caring members of the staff are those working in billing.I\'ve gone to the emergency department twice in the past three months because it is near my home in eastie, but the convenience really doesn\'t outweigh the poor treatment I received. Visit one was for a repetitive motion wrist injury. If my wrist moved at all I was in extreme pain to the point of tears. I made this clear to the nurse doing my pre-screening, and yet she not-so-gently repositioned my wrist to take my pulse not once but twice. On top of that pleasant experience, the RN that saw me checked my range of motion and nothing else. Within 20 minutes of walking into the facility I had a brace, a prescription for Motrin, and a diagnosis of, I kid you not, ""left wrist pain."" My second experience was just as fantastic. My face broke out in a rash, and I thought the cause might have been my new sunscreen, but hey, what do I know? I\'m not a doctor. Since it was spreading and not reacting to over the counter treatments I waltzed back on in. My pre-screening nurse didn\'t aggravate the itchy blisters on my face so that was an improvement from last time, but what confounded and confused me was the doctor\'s ""examination."" Dr. Pulaski entered the examination room and never came within a five foot radius of me. While leaning casually on the countertop to my left, he asked me about the ingredients in the sunscreen. I handed him the list from my phone, and he pondered it with his fully accredited and licensed wisdom. He then asked what brand the sunscreen was, and I responded ""Target brand"" thinking this was a pivotal piece of information. After handing my phone back to me, (arm fully outstretched because that 5ft radius seemed pretty important to him,) he said ""Lauren, we\'ll get you some medicine.""He didn\'t look at my face once. He had no idea if my rash was blisters, hives, a chemical burn, the plague, etc. He didn\'t even glance at a rubber glove. Soon after he left the same nurse came in, told me the name of a medication, gave me some pills (no description or list of side effects,) and handed me a stack of papers, that hilariously enough, diagnosed me as having a ""Skin Rash"" and told me to ""not use Target Brand sunscreen."" That\'s right, I\'m allergic to Target. I\'ll never be able to be a suburbanite now. I value speed of service in a lot of industries, like at Starbucks, or Uber, but obviously that same standard should not apply to my health care. If you only have 30 minutes and want someone with a medical degree to parrot your symptoms back at you without addressing the underlying cause, then the EBNHC emergency department is a perfect fit. Otherwise, take the time to go somewhere where they at least will diagnose you with the Latin equivalent of your symptoms.', 'So i have a Primary Care Physician at EBNHC.

This happened the last 2 times I made an appointment. Prior to that it was months and months of waiting to get an appointment. One of the reasons I have a PCP is because that doctor is familiar with me, my records, and details that ""assistants"" would not be privy too. Now it seems like you\'re just a number at EBNHC. Its really disappointing that I can\'t even see my own doctor. If you look at the reviews posted about EBNHC you will see that I am FAR from being the only person who is tired of the long waits and now, not being able to see your own doctor.

They will answer questions but you better ask a lot of them and make sure they are the right questions because no additional information will be given to you. This facility seems very shady and does not have the best interest of the patient in mind. What Bournewood is interested in is charging as much money to you as they possibly can. This is disgusting.

I had to put out a missing in danger with the police,wrote on the community in fb to see if someone would spot him because I had no idea where he was for 6 days now 3 of them days he never spoke to a Dr. because it's was a weekend and also the Monday was a holiday.He explained to him a Dr. that supposedly been there 40 yrs. how he was feeling and after seeing him for 2-3 minutes a day said he didn't belong there and thy had to get him him ASAP! Yet diagnosed him with ptsd,adhd,depression,said he was a nicotine,alcohol dependent!Two things...my child DOES NOT SMOKE never has nor does he use vaps.He went outside when others did to get air!! He told them that yet they said he should attend smoking sensation groups \xa0Sorry have to laugh at that because it's so obvious they do not listen nor care what the patient is saying.Also he drinks maybe on a Friday night.This is a man who holds down two jobs and is educated. He needed help for depression and they did NOTHING but rack up his Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance.Then upon releasing him they sent him home with ONLY his diagnosis papers NOTHING to show his work where he was and that he was safe to return to work duty. So my son calls them and these retards tell him oh we don't give them types of papers you have to get them from your primary care doctor. That's BS the girl was just being LAZY! WTH they were the ones who had him in their care,diagnosed him(supposedly) but yet couldn't write up a paper for his work. No one shows their job their diagnosis papers it's non of their business also not to mention,none professional.He's trying to go back to his normal routine and live life and these people are holding him up.

As parents we were largely kept in the dark, it was our first experience in an inpatient program - they offered us no updates. My child said security for keeping drugs out was a joke. They said pills were ground up and snorted, a practice learned and continued after leaving the facility, unfortunately. During intake I shared insomnia was a huge issue, they said they\'d give something to help sleep. Each day I\'d ask, had it been done? It was about 4 days later before they finally did. We\'d ask and they said they\'d pass the info along. they never did. Each day it was like they heard the info for the first time. 4 days this kid didn\'t sleep at night. They couldn\'t have cared less.My child had major anxiety of being in a solo room, a request to transfer to a roommate was requested by of this. That request was also never passed on.Finally it was release day. We arrived to outpatient, was sold one one thing about the program, there would be time for growth and groups. Not so. They watched movies???We called that night to make an appointment with the outpatient person, to discuss the day and next steps. They told us to arrive there the next am. Upon the next day, they were pissed we were there because they had other intakes and would not meet with us to discuss concerns. They said they didn\'t know who told us we could but no, they would not. We told them we wouldn\'t want to continue and they basically were like BYE!We don\'t live close and no way I would have randomly just showed up?!? Again, parents were a nuisance. They gave us no follow up plan we got nothing from them. It felt like they just wanted the money and didn\'t give a crap about the child and most certainly not the parents!

I am standing tall, without any medications, with hope and faith in my heart, in my mind, and in my very soul. My stay at Bournewood Hospital, although it was only for a short time, it changed my entire life...my entire outlook on life. Not because it was a hospitalization...I\'ve been hospitalized in the past...it is truly because of the entire experience...Since I\'ve been through so much in my 31 years of life (I was diagnosed as bipolar at 13/14 years of age) I\'ve taken antipsychotics, I\'ve taken anti depressants, and I\'ve taken anti anxiety pills...as well as a ptsd med...when I was 16, I overdosed on 56 pills...lithium and trileptal, with a few naproxen mixed in...my intention was to die...life was unbearable for me at that time in my life, and I just could not stand the thought of being in this world for even another second. I used the very pills that I was being prescribed to ""help me"" to try and end things...well, after coming back to life and back to consciousness...and angrily questioning the nurse why she saved me...I was shipped off to a mental hospital, where I stayed for a while, and then was forced to paticipate in an outpatient programs...none of it really helped me....nothing stopped the suicidal thoughts...nothing stopped my mind from wandering into the lost, empty, cruel world that it had been exposed to so early on....that is, nothing until now....Truly from my heart, from my clear mind, and my soul...My stay at Bournewood Hospital, both saved and changed my life forever...and I shall be forever grateful. Each and every staff member ALWAYS tried their hardest to make me comfortable, and welcome and safe...I truly appreciate everyone there...During my stay, I was also lucky enough to meet some incredible people, who would be labeled as I would be at the time....a patient. Well, I never felt like a patient in this hospital...I felt like apart of a community...a family that naturally had a few flaws...but together, we were working on them. I have a million wonderful stories to share about Bournewood...even when I was the only ""patient"" who was willing to do the yoga group...the staff member/miracle worker still not only ran the yoga group with just her and I...she really made me feel comfortable, and grateful...like every other group that was ever run, (that I got to be apart of) the staff member (If that\'s what you want to refer to them as) would also participate...i have had a HARD time leaving the house for years, but because of EVERYONE at Bournewood Hospital....I felt welcomed, and comfortable. Thank you so very much to everyone who I met during my stay....thank you to each and every one of you....Truly, from my heart....today, and always I will remember your guidance, and I will be the best that I can be, so that I can help make the world a better place. So that I can maybe, just maybe help ease some of the pain and suffering that my fellow human beings have had to endure....truly we are all humans....we are all equal...whether you understand the hardships we\'ve each personally suffered or not....A human is a human...Thank you So Much to everyone there who made me feel like a human again....like a hopeful, faithful, loving, living, happy human...thank you so much!!!!P.s. I will never reveal any names, because I know it is against the law, and all that...but secretly, my mom and I referred to one of the staff/miracle workers, as Prince Charming...his looks had nothing to do with the name, although quite handsome as well : ) ...he had this way about him...just being around him made you feel more comfortable...I wish him nothing but the very best that life has to offer, along with every other human being I met at Bournewood Hospital.

I can't complain too much because it's free."", 'Quick to schedule an appointment. \xa0Also impeccable bedside manner by the attending doctor and the testing staff.Two major issues with them.1) \xa0They don\'t follow up at all. \xa0I went in for lab work, I was told I\'d get results ""within a week"", both by the front desk and by their website. \xa0The day after I got an automatic email with a web-based account (mychart.bmc.org), where I could check my results when they were ready. \xa0Awesome & efficient, I think. \xa02 weeks later there were no results online (and still aren\'t 3 months after my visit). \xa0I called, and they gave me my results on the phone, with an attitude like they were just sitting on them for the last few days waiting for me to do exactly this -- call them when I thought they might be ready. \xa0I don\'t know what\'s worse -- making patients wait extra time to find out results, or how crappy it would be for someone with some major disease to have the front desk confirm their name on the phone and then give them their results in earshot of anyone waiting in the lobby (""Oh Mrs. Jane Doe? \xa0Last four digits of your social? \xa05555...let me check...yes, you came back positive for HIV. \xa0When can we schedule a follow up appointment?"") \xa0What\'s the point of your online system if you don\'t use it? \xa0I still don\'t have any official lab results from my visit, either online or mailed to me, so if a partner wants you to show them a clean bill of health you are S.O.L. if you come to get tested here. \xa0Keep that in mind.2) \xa0They are outrageously priced. \xa0The testing work is indeed free (I think), but that\'s it. \xa0I got an invoice after my visit showing they tried to collect over $60 from my insurance, got $40 (i.e. the MAXIMUM REASONABLE AMOUNT insurance thinks it should cost), and were billing me for the remainder. \xa0When I checked on it, the bill was actually for pharmacy services -- a single dose antibiotic to be exact, with a common retail price of $8-$10 in most pharmacies, but over $60 from them. \xa0I have no idea why it is so much higher. \xa0Maybe they insist on using brand name instead of generic, it wasn\'t discussed and I wasn\'t really given an option when they gave me the drugs in the clinic so I can\'t say. \xa0So just be mindful of this if you receive any treatments in the clinic, which is regular practice to do for common STDs before lab results are completed if you are high-risk -- i.e. you had contact with a partner who later informed you they found out they have an STD, which is probably why you\'re going to get tested in the first place. \xa0If you get treated there, you\'ll pay through the nose, especially if you came in without insurance because you thought it was all free. \xa0Maybe you\'d be better off asking for a prescription for any drugs they want to give you, taking it to a pharmacy and paying 85% less -- do you really need a doctor coaching you on how to take a pill?Great medical staff, but an administrative cluster-F.', ""Boston STD clinic is a great place for fast, free, and confidential testing.

Dr. Kumar is the best and most helpful and understanding doctor that I have ever had, and she is so incredibly knowledge about treating the body as a whole and not just masking symptoms with medications, but instead getting to the real root of the issue. She is a champion of and warrior for her patients and has been such a tremendous ally throughout my chronic Covid-19 battle. It\'s because of Dr. Kumar that I have received the help needed despite so much being unknown about this virus: that alone speaks volumes to her excellence as a practitioner, and is something that I now know to be a vitally important quality of a true medical practitioner ally, which all patients deserve and need.Furthermore, the nurses within this practice (the lovely Rachel in particular) called me weekly for *months* during my recovery to ensure that I wasn\'t neglected or ignored while I was recovering at home, and did so with SO much care, compassion and support.

But i have been there several times to visit loved ones and had nightmares about that place, even standing out front looking at it gives me the creeps! So after all that i really think ""MASS GENERAL"" IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST IN BOSTON! Thank you to all the wonderful workers at "" MASS GENERAL"" YOUR APPRECIATED']",48

MIT Medical,LVGVo4Jz6fLKHz2qTXyWjA,-71.0866,42.361309,"['When I was affiliated with MIT, I did not think MIT medical was that great. \xa0Given that there are other hospitals in the area--MGH, Brigham, BI, BU, Tufts, etc, I thought MIT doctors were probably the ones who couldn\'t make it to a hospital that\'s affiliated with the medical center. \xa0However, I think most of the doctors at MIT actually work at a different hospital and are at MIT part time. \xa0But if you think MIT was inefficient, wait until you get to the ""real world."" \xa0I recently had the misfortune of being sick. \xa0At MIT, if I couldn\'t see my PCP during the same day, I would go to Urgent Care. \xa0I decided to do the same at my PCP\'s office. \xa0All I needed to do was get a lab done so they could prescribe some meds for me. \xa0At MIT, I think it would have taken them about 30 minutes to see me at Urgent Care and give me results in 5. \xa0Then I would have to wait another 10-15 minutes for pharmacy to give me a prescription. \xa0For the same issue, it would probably take an hour, max an hour and half at MIT. \xa0At my new PCP, it took a total of 8 hours, about 5 phone calls, and another hour at the CVS pharmacy for the exact same issues. \xa0Efficiency, thy name is MIT!As for the staff, I wouldn\'t exactly call the MIT staff friendly, but they\'re probably on par with most other medical centers. \xa0I think most medical center have disgruntled employees while the doctors are generally pretty good. \xa0Overall, if you value your time and like efficiency, MIT Medical is actually really good. \xa0Before, I\'d probably have given it a 3 star. \xa0Having experience other places, my outlook for Medical has changed.', 'Horrible service. My PCP gives up on me and no longer responds when she is unable to make a diagnosis. They are uninterested in following up with what happens with you. Highly detached and berucratic.One doctor in urgent care had me promise after I was trying to convince her of crucial tests precribed by my PCP (who was not available that week and told me to pass by urgent care) that she would only do them if I promised she would not be responsible for following up with me on the test results. \xa0It was absolutely humiliating.', ""They really take the urgent out of urgent care. I've been to urgent care a few times and they have insane wait times. If you do not book an appointment online, wait times are normally around two hours. Today I booked an appointment online, showed up 5 minutes before my appointment, and had to sit in the waiting room for an hour before I was called. This totally defeats the purpose of booking an appointment online or giving fast service."", 'Misdiagnoses, missed diagnoses, and a lack of desire to find a diagnosis. \xa0There are some excellent providers at this practice, but, unfortunately, they are not the ones making decisions for \xa0your long term health care.Stay away.', ""Like most college hospitals, MIT Medical is awful. Here's just a few things I've encountered over the years. Wait times are high. Regularly wait 20+ minutes for scheduled appointments and 1+ hours for urgent care. Care is inconsistent. I went in twice within two days for pneumonia and chronic bronchitis. During the first visit, I was told to take Tylenol. During the second I was given the proper antibiotics.Doctors act more like therapists than actual physicians. During one visit, I could see my PCP holding her yawns back. During follow up, it was clear she wasn't listening. It sucks when medical professionals only pretend to listen.Doctors are quick to say you're just stressed. This is more applicable to students, but due to MIT's high stress environment, doctors will - very nicely - tell you that you're just stressed and then refer you to a mental health specialist. No efforts will be made to better understand your lifestyle, habits, diet, social life, etc."", 'I just received a fantastic response to my very negative review. Friendly, apologetic, caring &very constructive: An air purifier will be added to the window less room.', ""Being an MIT affiliate, I've found this place to be convenient and easy to work with, particularly the urgent care center, but also in regards to their regular services. \xa0So, I recently tweaked my ankle (I'm kind of a klutz when it comes to different-leveled stairs, or ups and downs from any heights, or walking in general). \xa0 It initially was not too bad, but by mid-afternoon I was still hurting, so I went over to Urgent Care to get it checked out. \xa0I was in and out within an hour, which is good considering that I would expect to wait longer at most places. \xa0Furthermore, the doctors I've dealt with have been both helpful and considerate, which is worth it as well."", 'MIT medical has always lacked luster, but it\'s gotten much worse in the last few years. Where wait times would be around 20 minutes for a scheduled appointment before, this year I experienced a 45 wait time and didn\'t even get to see the provider since I had to leave to pick up my kids. Didn\'t get a follow up call even from a nurse. Then, I called with a concern about a persistent pain I had recently, and was told the first appointment I could get, with a nurse, \xa0was in a week. I took it and the day before my appointment I got a voice message from a nurse saying they were ""checking in"". I called back to say thanks and confirm my appointment for the following day and was told that ""everyone has called in sick tomorrow, just go to urgent care"" Really? After a week of waiting. And everyone at the doctor\'s office has called in sick. Encouraging. It\'s rediculous. Another time, I went to urgent care because I was having a terrible allergic reaction to something that I couldn\'t identify and after 2 hours waiting in a room, no tests, nothing but a few questions, the attending doc told me it was probably just dry skin and asked me if I take too many showers because in Europe they only wash every other day (we\'re both American). I was let go even though it was clear something was terribly wrong. Turned out that I was having a drug reaction that multiplied the intensity of a previously undetected allergy to dander. I figured this out partly by google, and by calling the specialist who had prescribed the med causing the reaction. When I made an appointment to see the allergist, I waited a month. The week before the appointment I was told the doctor was going to be on vacation for 3 weeks and they had to reschedule. Another time I had to schedule an invasive day procedure and after my initial meeting with the specialist, the admin staff scheduled me for the procedure but didn\'t tell me. Like, never. So the doc ended up calling me from the nearby hospital on the morning that the procedure was supposed to be performed asking me why I hadn\'t checked in yet. 100% true story. Another time I had a pain in my side and was told it was all in my head. When I finally transferred my care my new doc and a different medical practice, I discovered it was a kidney stone. Some providers at MIT medical are nice people. And if the care you seek is no more complicated than an occasional cough or need for a vaccination, go forth! But if you\'re an adult that is beyond the legal drinking age, have normal health things come up from time to time, stay AWAY! It\'s one thing that generally people are disorganized, but sometimes they are completely incompetent. A patient\'s legit concerns, objections or complaints go into your chart and affect quality of follow on care IMHO. Generally MIT medical behaves like a cast of unemployed actors understudying for a rerun of the TV show ER but with regular office hours and DGAF attitude.', 'The first time I called my PCP, she asked me, ""are you pregnant?""I said, ""you could probably win Nobel Prize if you get me pregnant \'cuz I am a guy!""I recently got a bottle of antibiotics to cure my acne. I got a sense of how obsessed Americans are with antibiotics. No matter what problems you have, you have antibiotics first!', ""I don't know what MIT medical is like for guys, but for girls, it's like this:Girl: I have a sore throat and a feverDoctor: Are you sexually active?Girl: YesDoctor: Pregnancy test.Girl: I'm a little stressed out from school and I wanted to see a therapist.Doctor: Are you sexually active?Girl: Not lately.Doctor: Is there any chance you could be pregnant?Girl: Well, I mean, I do ovulate, so...Doctor: Pregnancy test.Girl: Hi, I fell out of a tree and my arm is broken right now.
